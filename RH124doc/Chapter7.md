# RH124 Revision Notebook: Chapter 7 - Control Access to Files

This notebook provides a detailed summary of Chapter 7 from the Red Hat System Administration I (RH124) course, based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9/10. It focuses on managing file system permissions to control access to files and directories, with comprehensive explanations, commands, practical examples, common pitfalls, best practices, and revision exercises for effective learning and real-world application.

## Chapter 7: Control Access to Files

### Key Concepts

- **Linux File Permissions**:
  - Every file and directory has associated permissions defining who can read, write, or execute it.
  - Permissions are assigned to three categories: **owner** (user), **group**, and **others**.
  - Permissions types:
    - **Read (r)**: View file contents or list directory contents (value: 4).
    - **Write (w)**: Modify file contents or create/delete files in a directory (value: 2).
    - **Execute (x)**: Run a file as a program or enter a directory (value: 1).
- **Permission Representation**:
  - Symbolic: `rwxr-xr-x` (owner: rwx, group: r-x, others: r-x).
  - Numeric (octal): `755` (rwx = 4+2+1=7, r-x = 4+1=5, r-x = 5).
  - Example: `rw-r--r--` = `644` (owner: rw, group: r, others: r).
- **Key Files**:
  - Permissions are stored in the file system’s inode, viewable with `ls -l`.
  - Ownership is tied to User ID (UID) and Group ID (GID) in `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group`.
- **Special Permissions**:
  - **SetUID (s)**: File executes as the owner (e.g., `passwd` runs as root). Octal: 4000.
  - **SetGID (s)**: File executes as group or inherits group for directory contents. Octal: 2000.
  - **Sticky Bit (t)**: Restricts deletion in directories to owners (e.g., `/tmp`). Octal: 1000.
- **Default Permissions**:
  - Controlled by the user’s **umask**, which subtracts permissions from default (files: 666, directories: 777).
  - Example: `umask 022` → files: 666-022=644, directories: 777-022=755.
  - View umask: `umask` (numeric) or `umask -S` (symbolic).
- **File Access Control Lists (ACLs)**:
  - Extend standard permissions for fine-grained control (e.g., specific users or groups).
  - Managed with `setfacl` and `getfacl`.
- **RHEL 9/10 Notes**:
  - Enhanced ACL support with better performance in RHEL 10.
  - RHEL Lightspeed (RHEL 10) can suggest permission commands (e.g., `rhel lightspeed "set read-only for group"`).

### Important Commands

- **Viewing Permissions**:

  ```bash
  ls -l file.txt  # Show permissions, owner, group (e.g., -rw-r--r-- user1 group1)
  ls -ld /mydir  # Show directory permissions
  stat file.txt  # Detailed file info, including permissions and ownership
  ```
  
- **Changing Permissions**:

  ```bash
  chmod u+rwx file.txt  # Add read, write, execute for owner
  chmod g-w file.txt  # Remove write for group
  chmod o=r file.txt  # Set read-only for others
  chmod 644 file.txt  # Set permissions numerically (rw-r--r--)
  chmod -R 755 /mydir  # Apply recursively to directory
  ```

- **Changing Ownership**:

  ```bash
  chown user1 file.txt  # Change owner to user1
  chown user1:group1 file.txt  # Change owner and group
  chown -R user1:group1 /mydir  # Apply recursively
  chgrp group1 file.txt  # Change group only
  chgrp -R group1 /mydir  # Recursive group change
  ```

- **Special Permissions**:

  ```bash
  chmod u+s program  # Set SetUID (e.g., -rwsr-xr-x)
  chmod g+s /shared  # Set SetGID on directory
  chmod +t /tmp  # Set sticky bit (e.g., drwxrwxrwt)
  chmod 4755 program  # SetUID + rwx for owner, rx for others
  ```

- **Managing umask**:

  ```bash
  umask  # Display current umask (e.g., 0022)
  umask 027  # Set umask (e.g., files: 640, directories: 750)
  umask -S  # Show symbolic umask (e.g., u=rwx,g=rx,o=)
  ```

- **File ACLs**:

  ```bash
  setfacl -m u:user2:rw file.txt  # Grant user2 read/write access
  setfacl -m g:group2:rx /mydir  # Grant group2 read/execute
  getfacl file.txt  # View ACLs
  setfacl -x u:user2 file.txt  # Remove user2’s ACL
  setfacl -b file.txt  # Remove all ACLs
  ```

### Practical Examples

- **Scenario: Secure a Configuration File**:
  - Restrict `/etc/myconfig` to owner-only access:

    ```bash
    sudo chown root:root /etc/myconfig
    sudo chmod 600 /etc/myconfig
    ls -l /etc/myconfig  # Verify: -rw------- root root
    ```

- **Scenario: Share a Directory**:
  - Create a shared directory for `developers` group:

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir /shared
    sudo groupadd developers
    sudo chown :developers /shared
    sudo chmod 770 /shared
    sudo chmod g+s /shared  # New files inherit group
    ls -ld /shared  # Verify: drwxrws--- root developers
    ```

- **Scenario: Set Up a Public Directory**:
  - Allow all users to read files in `/public`:

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir /public
    sudo chmod 755 /public
    ls -ld /public  # Verify: drwxr-xr-x
    ```

- **Scenario: Use ACLs for Specific Access**:
  - Grant `user2` write access to `project.txt` without changing standard permissions:

    ```bash
    setfacl -m u:user2:rw project.txt
    getfacl project.txt  # Verify ACL entry
    ```

- **Daily Use: Check and Fix Permissions**:

  - Find files with incorrect permissions:

    ```bash
    find /home -type f -perm /007  # Files writable by others
    chmod -R o-w /home/user1  # Remove others’ write access
    ```

- **Scenario: SetUID for a Script**:
  - Allow a script to run as owner:

    ```bash
    sudo chmod u+s /usr/local/bin/myscript
    ls -l /usr/local/bin/myscript  # Verify: -rwsr-xr-x
    ```

### Common Pitfalls

- **Incorrect Permissions**: Setting `777` (world-writable) is insecure; use least privilege (e.g., `644` for files, `755` for directories).
- **Forgetting `-R`**: Without `-R`, `chmod` or `chown` only affects the target, not directory contents.
- **Misusing SetUID/SetGID**: Applying to untrusted scripts can lead to security risks (e.g., privilege escalation).
- **Ignoring umask**: Default umask (e.g., `022`) may create overly permissive files. Set stricter umask (e.g., `027`) in `~/.bashrc`.
- **ACL Conflicts**: ACLs override standard permissions but can be confusing if not documented. Use `getfacl` to verify.
- **Permission Denied Errors**: Operations in system directories (e.g., `/etc`) require `sudo`. Check ownership with `ls -l`.

### Best Practices and Tips

- **Follow Least Privilege**: Grant only necessary permissions (e.g., `640` for sensitive files).
- **Use Groups for Collaboration**: Assign shared directories to a group with `g+rw` and SetGID (`g+s`).
- **Backup Before Changes**: Copy critical files (e.g., `sudo cp /etc/myconfig /etc/myconfig.bak`) before modifying permissions.
- **Verify Changes**: Always use `ls -l` or `getfacl` after changing permissions or ownership.
- **Automate Checks**: Script permission audits (e.g., `find / -perm -4000` for SetUID files).
- **RHEL 10 Tip**: Use Lightspeed for permission tasks (e.g., `rhel lightspeed "make directory group-writable"` suggests `chmod g+rw`).
- **Document ACLs**: Maintain a log of ACL changes (e.g., `getfacl /shared > acl_backup.txt`).

### Revision Quiz/Notes

- **Questions**:
  - What does `chmod 750 /mydir` do? (Owner: rwx, group: rx, others: no access.)
  - What’s the role of the sticky bit? (Prevents non-owners from deleting files in a directory.)
  - How do you grant `user3` read access to `file.txt` via ACL? (`setfacl -m u:user3:r file.txt`)
- **Quick Exercise**:
  - Create a directory `/data`, set owner to `root`, group to `analysts`, permissions to `rwxr-x---`, and add ACL for `user2` with read/write:

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir /data
    sudo groupadd analysts
    sudo chown root:analysts /data
    sudo chmod 750 /data
    sudo setfacl -m u:user2:rw /data
    ls -ld /data; getfacl /data
    ```

- **Self-Test**:
  - Explain the output of `ls -l` for `-rwxr-xr-t` (owner: rwx, group: rx, others: rx, sticky bit set).
  - Why use `chown -R`? (Applies ownership changes to directory and all contents.)
