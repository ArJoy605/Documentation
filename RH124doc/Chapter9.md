# RH124 Revision Notebook: Chapter 9 - Control Services and Daemons

This notebook provides a detailed summary of Chapter 9 from the Red Hat System Administration I (RH124) course, based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9/10. It focuses on managing services and daemons using `systemd`, with comprehensive explanations, commands, practical examples, common pitfalls, best practices, and revision exercises for effective learning and real-world application.

## Chapter 9: Control Services and Daemons

### Key Concepts
- **Services and Daemons**:
  - A **service** is a program or set of programs managed by the system, typically running in the background (e.g., `sshd` for SSH, `httpd` for web server).
  - A **daemon** is a background process, often ending in `d` (e.g., `crond` for scheduled tasks).
  - Services are critical for system functionality, such as networking, logging, or web hosting.
- **Systemd Overview**:
  - `systemd` is the default init system in RHEL, responsible for starting, stopping, and managing services.
  - Units: Services (`.service`), timers (`.timer`), mounts (`.mount`), etc.
  - Configuration files: Stored in `/etc/systemd/system` (custom) or `/usr/lib/systemd/system` (default).
- **Service States**:
  - **Enabled**: Starts automatically at boot.
  - **Disabled**: Does not start at boot.
  - **Running/Active**: Currently executing.
  - **Stopped/Inactive**: Not running but may be started.
  - **Failed**: Service failed to start or crashed.
- **Service Management**:
  - Use `systemctl` to control services (start, stop, enable, disable, check status).
  - Services can be system-wide or user-specific (e.g., user services in `~/.config/systemd/user`).
- **RHEL 9/10 Notes**:
  - Improved `systemd` performance and logging in RHEL 10.
  - RHEL Lightspeed (RHEL 10) can suggest service management commands (e.g., `rhel lightspeed "restart web server"` suggests `systemctl restart httpd`).

### Important Commands
- **Service Status**:
  ```
  systemctl status sshd  # Show status of sshd service (active, inactive, failed)
  systemctl is-active sshd  # Check if running (returns "active" or "inactive")
  systemctl is-enabled sshd  # Check if enabled at boot
  ```
- **Managing Services**:
  ```
  systemctl start sshd  # Start service
  systemctl stop sshd  # Stop service
  systemctl restart sshd  # Stop and start service
  systemctl reload sshd  # Reload configuration without stopping (if supported)
  systemctl enable sshd  # Enable service to start at boot
  systemctl disable sshd  # Disable auto-start at boot
  systemctl enable --now sshd  # Enable and start immediately
  ```
- **Listing Services**:
  ```
  systemctl list-units --type=service  # List all loaded services
  systemctl list-units --type=service --all  # Include inactive services
  systemctl list-unit-files --type=service  # List service files (enabled/disabled)
  ```
- **Troubleshooting Services**:
  ```
  journalctl -u sshd  # View logs for sshd service
  journalctl -xe  # View recent system logs with errors
  systemctl is-failed sshd  # Check if service failed
  ```
- **Masking Services**:
  ```
  systemctl mask sshd  # Prevent service from starting
  systemctl unmask sshd  # Re-enable service
  ```

### Practical Examples
- **Scenario: Manage SSH Service**:
  - Check if SSH is running:
    ```
    systemctl status sshd
    ```
    Output: Shows `active (running)` or `inactive`.
  - Start SSH if stopped:
    ```
    sudo systemctl start sshd
    ```
  - Enable at boot:
    ```
    sudo systemctl enable sshd
    ```
- **Scenario: Restart Web Server**:
  - Restart Apache (`httpd`) after configuration change:
    ```
    sudo systemctl restart httpd
    ```
  - Reload without interrupting connections (if supported):
    ```
    sudo systemctl reload httpd
    ```
  - Verify: `systemctl status httpd`.
- **Scenario: Troubleshoot Failed Service**:
  - Check if `httpd` failed:
    ```
    systemctl is-failed httpd
    journalctl -u httpd -b  # View logs since last boot
    ```
  - Fix (e.g., correct config in `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`), then restart:
    ```
    sudo systemctl restart httpd
    ```
- **Scenario: Prevent Unwanted Service**:
  - Mask a service to prevent accidental start:
    ```
    sudo systemctl mask bluetooth
    systemctl status bluetooth  # Shows "masked"
    ```
- **Daily Use: List Running Services**:
  - View active services:
    ```
    systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running
    ```
  - Save to file for audit:
    ```
    systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running > services.txt
    ```
- **Scenario: Monitor Service Logs**:
  - Watch real-time logs for `crond`:
    ```
    journalctl -u crond -f
    ```

### Common Pitfalls
- **Forgetting `sudo`**: Service management requires root privileges (e.g., `sudo systemctl start sshd`).
- **Restart vs. Reload**: `restart` stops and starts, potentially disrupting users; use `reload` when possible (e.g., `systemctl reload httpd`).
- **Masked Services**: Attempting to start a masked service fails. Check with `systemctl status` and unmask if needed.
- **Ignoring Logs**: Service failures often have clues in `journalctl -u service`. Always check logs before retrying.
- **Disabling Critical Services**: Disabling services like `sshd` can lock you out of remote access. Verify impact first.
- **Unit Not Found**: Misspelling service names (e.g., `systemctl start ssh` instead of `sshd`) causes errors. Use tab completion.

### Best Practices and Tips
- **Check Status First**: Always run `systemctl status service` before and after changes to confirm state.
- **Use `reload` When Possible**: Minimizes downtime (e.g., `systemctl reload httpd` for config changes).
- **Monitor Logs**: Use `journalctl -u service -f` for real-time debugging.
- **Enable Essential Services**: Ensure critical services (e.g., `sshd`, `crond`) are enabled (`systemctl enable`).
- **Script Service Checks**: Automate status checks:
  ```
  for s in sshd httpd; do systemctl status $s >> service_status.log; done
  ```
- **RHEL 10 Tip**: Use Lightspeed for service tasks (e.g., `rhel lightspeed "check service status"` suggests `systemctl status`).
- **Backup Configurations**: Before editing service configs (e.g., `/etc/httpd`), back up (e.g., `sudo cp /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf.bak`).

### Revision Quiz/Notes
- **Questions**:
  - What command starts and enables `httpd` in one step? (`systemctl enable --now httpd`)
  - Whatâ€™s the difference between `restart` and `reload`? (`restart` stops and starts; `reload` updates config without stopping.)
  - How do you view logs for `sshd`? (`journalctl -u sshd`)
- **Quick Exercise**:
  - Check if `crond` is running, enable it, and view its logs:
    ```
    systemctl status crond
    sudo systemctl enable crond
    journalctl -u crond -n 10
    ```
- **Self-Test**:
  - Explain the output of `systemctl status sshd` (shows service state, PID, recent logs).
  - Why mask a service? (Prevents accidental start, e.g., for security or resource management.)
