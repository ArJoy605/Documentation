# Detailed explanation of **vmlinuz** including how it works during boot

##

---

### What is **vmlinuz**?

* **vmlinuz** is the **compressed Linux kernel executable** file.

* The name breaks down as:

  * **vm** = Virtual Memory
  * **linuz** = Linux (with a 'z' indicating compression)

* It is the **core component of the Linux operating system** responsible for managing hardware, system resources, and running processes.

---

### Role of vmlinuz in the boot process

1. When the system boots, the **bootloader** (like GRUB) loads the `vmlinuz` file into memory.
2. The kernel inside `vmlinuz` initializes the hardware devices (CPU, memory, disks, network, etc.).
3. It mounts the root filesystem and starts the initial user-space process (usually `systemd` or `init`).
4. The system transitions from bootloader control to the Linux operating system control.

---

### How **vmlinuz** works internally during boot

* The kernel image `vmlinuz` is compressed to save space; it must be decompressed first.
* When the bootloader loads `vmlinuz`, it transfers control to a small decompression routine at the start of the kernel image.
* This routine decompresses the full kernel into memory.
* After decompression, the kernel initializes system hardware by detecting and loading drivers.
* It sets up virtual memory (paging and memory management).
* The kernel mounts the initial RAM disk (`initramfs`) which contains tools and drivers necessary to mount the real root filesystem.
* Once the real root filesystem is mounted, the kernel starts the first user process (`init` or `systemd`), handing over control to user space.

---

### Location and naming

* Typically found in the `/boot` directory, e.g. `/boot/vmlinuz-5.15.0-60.el8.x86_64`
* The filename often includes the kernel version for clarity.

---

### Why is it compressed?

* To reduce disk space usage.
* To speed up loading into memory by the bootloader.

---

### Related files

* **initramfs or initrd**: Initial RAM filesystem loaded alongside `vmlinuz` that contains drivers and scripts needed to mount the real root filesystem.
* **System.map**: Symbol table used for debugging the kernel.

## Understanding the AppStream Repository in Oracle Linux

---

### What is **AppStream**?

* **AppStream** (Application Stream) is a **software repository** introduced in RHEL 8 / Oracle Linux 8 and later.
* It provides a large collection of **user-space applications, runtimes, and development tools** separate from the core OS.

---

### Purpose of AppStream

* Separates **core operating system packages** from **optional applications and modules**.
* Allows users to install different versions or streams of software without impacting the base OS.
* Enables modularity: you can choose specific versions of software stacks (e.g., different Python or Node.js versions).

---

### What does AppStream contain?

* Application packages like web servers, databases, language runtimes, desktop environments.
* Development tools such as compilers, interpreters, and libraries.
* Modules for different versions or variants of software (e.g., Python 3.6 vs 3.8).
* Popular packages include:

  * **httpd** (Apache web server)
  * **mariadb** (database server)
  * **python3**, **nodejs** (programming language runtimes)
  * **gnome-desktop** (graphical desktop environment)
  * **gcc**, **make** (development tools)

---

### How AppStream works with BaseOS

* **BaseOS** provides the minimal, core operating system packages necessary to run the system.
* **AppStream** provides optional and additional software that you can install as needed.
* Both repositories together provide a full OS environment.

---

### In a Kickstart or repo file

```bash
repo --name="AppStream" --baseurl=http://server/OL8/AppStream
```

The installer pulls additional packages from AppStream as specified.

### Summary

| Feature      | Description                        |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Purpose      | Provides applications and modules  |
| Modularity   | Supports multiple versions/streams |
| Examples     | Web servers, runtimes, desktops    |
| Relationship | Supplements BaseOS with extra apps |

## Detailed explanation of the **BaseOS repository**

---

### What is **BaseOS repository**?

* **BaseOS** is one of the main repositories in RHEL 8 / Oracle Linux 8 and later.
* It contains the **core operating system packages** essential for a minimal, functional Linux system.

---

### Purpose of BaseOS

* Provides the **fundamental system components** required for booting, running, and maintaining the OS.
* Ensures that the system has all necessary libraries, tools, and utilities to operate.

---

### What does BaseOS contain?

* Core system libraries like `glibc`, `systemd`, `openssl`, and others.
* Essential utilities such as `bash`, `coreutils`, `rpm`, `dracut`.
* Basic device drivers and kernel modules.
* Packages required to boot and run the system but **not** user applications or developer tools.

---

### How BaseOS works with AppStream

* BaseOS forms the **foundation** of the OS installation.
* AppStream adds **optional user-space applications and modules** on top of BaseOS.
* Together, they provide a complete environment.

---

### In a Kickstart or repo file of BaseOS

```bash
repo --name="BaseOS" --baseurl=http://server/OL8/BaseOS
```

The installer fetches minimal OS packages from BaseOS to build the system.

## Summary of **vmlinuz**, **BaseOS repo**, and **AppStream repo**

---

### vmlinuz

* Compressed Linux kernel image loaded by the bootloader.
* Responsible for hardware initialization, memory management, and starting the OS.
* Located in `/boot/`, decompressed at boot to start the system.

### BaseOS Repository

* Contains core operating system packages and essential system libraries.
* Provides the minimal foundation needed for the OS to run.
* Includes basic utilities, device drivers, and core components.

### AppStream Repository

* Provides additional user-space applications, development tools, and modular software.
* Supports multiple versions/streams of software like runtimes, databases, desktops.
* Supplements BaseOS with optional software packages for customization.
